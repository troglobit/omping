![OMPing Banner](extras/img/omping-banner.png "Open Multicast Ping")

The omping tool is a pure UDP client and server wrapped in a small
binary.  Perfectly suited for verifying multicast connectivity on your
local network.

Compared to traditional ping omping does not use ICMP.  It is based on
RFC draft <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mboned-ssmping-08> and
can thus test many different aspects of a setup:

> “In addition to checking reception of multicast (SSM or ASM), the
> protocol can provide related information such as multicast tree setup
> time, the number of hops the packets have traveled, as well as packet
> delay and loss.”

Features:

- Similar user experience as classic ping tool
- Ping multiple hosts at once
- Any-source and Source-specific Multicast
